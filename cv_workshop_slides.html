# **Workshop goals**

## Just Write It Down!

## Introduce New Tools

## Repurpose Old Tools

## Don't Overshare — Shine!

???
Who I am and why I am talking

Talk about my journey to R

Talk about finding RLadies

Intimated by the preceived gulf between my skills

I want to lay out what we will cover today
Four parts

---
# What this workshop is not about



### Where to find your dream job*

### Getting the skills for your dream job

### Networking

### Negotiating terms

### Discussing your CV specifics 

.footnote[[*] Job hunting is a horrible process — it's not you!]

???
Here's what we won't talk about  

These are important things, but just not what we are covering today 

I mention them because they are super important part of the job process

And a reminder that a CV is just part of the process  

If fact the idea of a dream job is sort of lame

And while these aren't the goals of today's talk, if there is interest we can host another one

Share quick story of returning to work after having a baby

# CV Basics, *Just the facts, ma'am*

???
You can be the most impressive person in the world/best candidate for a job, but if the person doesn't already know you you have to communicate it
--

### The **most** important thing is to be able to find it
--

### Raw CV info isn't something special, but you need to mark it for **future you** to be able to sort through your 50K emails
--

### Quickstart guide

  + Open your email  
  + Start a new message  
  + Address it to your ~~self~~ *future* self 
  + Put "Raw CV info" in your subject
  + Write some tidbit of career information in the body
  + Send it

# CV Basics, Terminology

### Resume or Résumé  
  + Fancy French word for 'summary'
  + In American English both spellings are acceptable
  + And yes the word resume (**meaning to restart or to continue**) is spelled the same but said differently
  + Generally, a short form tailored for the current position of interest
  
---
class: top

# CV Basics, Terminology

### Curriculum Vitae aka *CV*
  + Fancy Latin for 'course of life'
  + Generally, a painfully exhaustive and long form

# CV Basics, Terminology

## And that's only half of it!
  + The use of these terms differs in different English speaking locales!

# CV Basics, **Know thine enemy...**

???
Find out!
Government jobs are notorious for this
you should consider asking, and if there is no one to ask, then question whether it is worth your time applying
I am super biased against cold call web submissions due to very bad personal experience
--

## Some positions just say "attach a resume"
--

## Many academic positions want a CV
--

## And of course some positions demand some horrible custom form

# My Example Workflow and CV

Let's take a look at where I was a few weeks ago and where I am now

- Information everywhere **and** nowhere

- Every CV was a three part problem
  + Find all my information
  + Decide what to include
  + Format it
  
- Disappointing results — I'm not a designer!

- Not leveraging my past efforts

It is important to remember the best process is the process that works well (*or at least good enough*) for you!

Prepare yourself
Remeber I'm being vulernable here showing you my organizational sins

Information leakage (like socks in the wash)

# Workflow

My **absolute basic workflow** 
 * I send myself an email that has   
 "Raw CV info" somewhere in it.

--

My **black tie workflow** 
 * I dump stuff in a googlesheet.

--

My **white tie workflow** 
 * I dump stuff in a googlesheet     
 in a highly structured way!

I seriously think it makes very little difference what your final processing step is, it is the steps of collecting your data in one place

# Take a peak at my sheet


???
I started this method and didn't have much success until I found the Nick Strayer's datadrivencv package.

Storage coupled with usage and deployment

Unstructured and structured

Only some sheets and columns are used

THERE IS NO Lockin! You can use the data easily for any format

# Take a peak at my example CV

NOTE THIS IS NOT REAL INFORMATION (some is, some is not, some is aspirational)

Versions of my cv can be saved with a name that means something: MaraAlexeev_BCHcv.pdf

I can run a script that makes a pdf version and an html version at the same time.

It places both into my /docs folder so that when I push to my github it updates my github page.

And my personal website is linked to that github page so I only have to update that not my website!

The basic script is in the datadrivencv 

I don't have this currently active because I am still in the process of updating my REAL cv, but I can see it because I have access to my private repo,

# Don't Overshare — Shine

???
I'm gonna say more controversial things: people don't read things

---
# Shine

### Focus on skills

### Make it loud and proud...and put it on top

### Say more, by saying less
---
# Shine

Have a good example to use for skill or accomplishment on your CV 

Be able to send a *good enough* CV to someone in a few minutes




---
# Proofreading and revising

A huge benefit of reusing past work is refining it!

Put it away and see it with fresh eyes

CV pipeline is like reusing good, well written code

# My next steps

Work on a custom look
+ might have to learn some `CSS`

Make some additional templates
+ A pretty cover letter template
+ "From the desk of" template

Learn a bit more about hiring laws/policies

Figure out some private stuff with `googlesheets4` and **Github**

---
# Things I learned

The dreaded, the encoding error...twice

```usethis::edit_r_profile()```

**xaringan**
+ Example of done is done

Brave enough to start responding to issues on **Github**

Though not brave enough yet for **StackOverflow**

Stealing scripts

Reading package code
