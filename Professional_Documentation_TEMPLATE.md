# Professional Documentation TEMPLATE

## Introduction to this document

Written by @Mara A in August 2019 to share with pediatric resident physicians. Please modify and share as is useful for you.

I highly recommend always using the date format of YYYY-MM-DD. I promise you it will make your life better if you don’t have to remember if you started work somewhere Jan 2nd or Feb 1st ten years later. 

This is a document designed to save your time later on. Medicine is full of paperwork including professional paperwork. The exact appearance of what you write below is not important. What is important is to record items in a centralized location — with or without pretty formatting. The information here will be very helpful in writing your CV or resume, job applications, crafting personal statements, or just filling out credentialing paperwork. 

Another TO DO beyond the scope of this document is to consider using a secure password management system. There are so many websites we log into as physicians, there is no way to keep them all in our head. There are many good apps available and they are probably all better than writing them down in your unsecured notes app on your phone.

# Ten year plan

People tend to overestimate what they can do in a year, but underestimate what the can do in 10. I challenge you to write down goals however big or small on this template. It is a great exercise to see if your actions are in line with your personal and professional goals. 

# Education History

Areas to include:

- Dates of attendance, get dates if possible many forms require a day like 14 Aug 2012
- Date of graduation
- Majors and minors
- GPA or honors

# Employment History

Request a pdf or hard copy of employment history from HR when you leave to save yourself the hassle if you need it in the future. Also, get the contact information from HR on who you should contact for verification if you need it in the future. Sometimes potential employers will want direct communication with your former company.

# Project Portfolio

You will work on lots of small to large projects. As time passes you will forget the details of projects that you were involved in even projects where you had a major role. I recommend you put all projects here as you start them. Even if you don’t complete them,  you can put the materials aside for another time or record a small lesson  you took away from the project. 


- Describe the project. What was the inspiration?
- Consider estimating time spent. 
- Include dates. 
- Include links to deliverable. 
- Include description of what you personally did.
- If the project had funding list the amount and source. 
- Record name and contact information of other collaborators.

# Evaluations

You are often emailed or given rotation or teaching evaluations. If not in electronic forms, scan these and link to them here. 


# Important Experiences

Jot a few thoughts down about the first time you worked in place you loved or a meaningful experience. Great place to review when you are applying for fellowship or have to write a personal statement. 

# Address History

You are likely to have a background report and criminal record history done as part of pre-employment intake as part of working in hospitals and clinics. I was once asked to provide 10 years of addresses which included residency, medical school, and undergraduate. One surprisingly good record of your address can be searching your email account or looking at Amazon order history and seeing the shipping addresses. 


| Address | Start date | End date |
